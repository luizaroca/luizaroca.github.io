# Free Flow RPG

These rules are a framework that can be tweaked, feel free to change and adapt it as you wish, the standard rules and values are there for anyone that wishes to simply dive in without having to worry about picking the system apart. 

### Dice Rolling Mechanism

Replace dice rolling by a single d20 roll to simplify rolling. Players can not initiate a roll without the request of the GM. Players always describe their intentions narratively then the GM will gauge whether a dice roll is needed or not. When the GM announces the need of a dice roll players are free to announce the aspects they want to invoke during that dice roll, these aspects must be narratively related to the action being performed.

### Aspects

Aspects are adjectives or descriptors that can be invoked by players or GMs during rolls, they can both contribute or hinder a player's action. Aspects have an aspect rating of how much they can modify a given roll starting at a 1. Further actions can increase the rating of an existing aspect or create new ones. The maximum value an aspect can have is 5.

- **Creation**: Players can create aspects during gameplay through their actions. Not all actions create aspects; it depends on the quality of the narrative and the GM’s discretion. _(Example: A player can turn off all the lights in a patio to create the aspect "Cover of the Night" with a start rating of 1 that can later be beneficial to their plans. Another player, then, can make a roll to try to see if they can sneak in, and by succeeding they can choose to describe the sky as being cloudy with no moon and stars and improve the same "Cover of the Night" aspect by 1)_ While this rule set present some specific actions and situations to create aspects the GM is free to introduce them when it makes sense narratively for them to exist and players can suggest aspects outside of the scope of the methods here described.
    
- **Player Invocation**: Players can invoke *narratively relevant* aspects to gain the corresponding bonus if the aspect is positively relevant to the action being taken. By default, players are limited to 2 aspect invocations per action. _(Example: Players can invoke the "Cover of the Night" aspect of a rating of 2 to add its value to a roll to determine whether they successfully hide from a patrolling guard)_
    
- **GM Invocation**: The GM can also invoke aspects during rolls to modify the value of the dice roll. Ratings of aspects invoked this way can be added to the roll when beneficial or subtracted from the roll when detrimental. _(Example: The GM can invoke the same "Cover of the Night" aspect of a rating of 2 to negatively impact a roll of a player that wants to see if they are being followed)_
    
- **Narrative relevancy:** Aspects can only be invoked when they are meaningfully relevant to the action being performed. This relevancy can be obvious in some cases, in other cases they may need narrative context to become relevant. Player are encouraged to exercise their creativity when declaring an aspect invocation. GMs have the final say of when an aspect is relevant to an action and they should encourage and reward players creativity and attention to detail when creating the narrative correlations to invoke aspects. Aspect invocations should be an opportunity for players to engage both mechanically and narratively in meaningful and creative ways with their characters and the scene.
    
- **Conditions**: Condition aspects (e.g., "Leg Injury") can be created to represent ongoing effects. These can be invoked to gain bonuses or impose penalties. _(Example: A player can trip on an unseen obstacle due to the darkness and gain the temporary aspect of "Bruised Ankle" at the rating of 1. That aspect can be used negatively by the GM on athletic rolls but can also be invoked by the player to try and get help on social rolls)_
- Bellow is a table with some suggestions for temporary character conditions to use in scenes and sessions, these are meant to be over quickly. GMs are free to reveal or hide the modifier effects to the players, these modifiers can rank up when conditions are repeatedly inflicted.


| **Temporary Condition** | **Description**                           | **Modifier**                                |

- **Items**: Items can be represented as semi-permanent aspects acquired by players, not all items are aspects though, only the ones that can be relevant in completing tasks and are of notable qualities. For instance armor items can be invoke when resolving combat rolls as the target of an attack while weapons can be invoked when performing the attack.  
    
- **Magic and super powers:** When using magic/super power systems, the magic schools or types of power can be represented as additional aspects with degrees of ratings that can be added to the dice rolls when the players invoke their magical capabilities. Using these systems will allow players to add an additional modifier on top of the base modifier limits to display their supernatural powers. The GM may choose to demand a resource expenditure when adding these aspects to a roll, like stress or mana points.
    
- **Exhausted Aspects:** Aspects can become exhausted due to a number of reasons; when an aspect is exhausted, it cannot be invoked during a roll until it is not exhausted anymore.

- **Exerting Aspects:** After rolling for an action a player may exhaust a *narratively relevant* aspect (previously exhausted or not) until the end of a scene to reroll the dice, aspects invoked in the roll can also be exerted this way without losing their bonus on that roll. 
    
- **Aspect cards**: Instead of aspects on a player sheet, aspects can be represented by playing cards held in hand or laid out on the table, and are played when invoked. Types of cards vary by color (character major, character minor, temporary, extra). Players start with their default aspects and can acquire more during the game. Aspect cards can also be used to track objects, NPC and scene aspects. For instance, when players discover a weakness on an enemy, the GM can lay out a card and write the aspect and its rating, same thing for scene elements and items.
    
- ~~***"Negative" Aspects**: Some aspects may be referred as negative aspects, these aspects work just like regular aspects but can not be invoke by their owners. The GM may invoke that aspect negatively on a roll performed by the aspect owner. Other players and the GM may otherwise invoke those aspects normally, either positively or negatively.*~~

### Base Character Aspects

Character Aspects replace skill levels and will be added to the roll when applicable. Players will start with **2 major Aspects** with a rating of 2 described narratively on their sheets and **2** **minor Aspects** with a rating of 1, these 4 Aspects will compose their core character skillset. Major aspects can be upgraded up to a 5 modifier, while minor aspects are limited to a 3 modifier maximum.

When players roll they can choose up to 1 major and up to 1 minor Aspects to invoke and add to their roll. 

***Optional**:* Players can also start the game with 1 condition and 1 extra aspect (usually an item)

| **Negative Condition**             | **Description**                              | **Modifier**                                  |

### Goal Track

Set at the character creation, defines the character's main goal when acting, must be related to the group overall, GM and players should discuss the best goals for each character. Can be changed at the beginning of each scene based on **prior aspects,** can be zoomed in into detailed goal based on prior goal for instance, or changed based on new priorities. GMs can set specific Goals for the group or individuals based on narrative turns.

Whenever situations change drastically GMs are encouraged to treat the situation as a  change of scene so players can reevaluate their goals.

When acting according to their goals players can add their regular maximum number of Aspects to a roll, when not they subtract 1 from the maximum Aspects to add.

Players are encouraged to correlate these goals and relevant Aspects.

### Setting Difficulties

The GM sets the difficulty level for tasks, adjusted for the d20 roll. Here are some example difficulties:

|TSN|PSQ|
|---|---|
|35|Legendary|
|30|Very Difficult|
|25|Difficult|
|20|Very Hard|
|15|Hard|
|10|Average|
|5|Easy|

### Resolving Rolls

1. **Determine Aspects**: Identify the character’s Aspects relevant to the task.
2. **Roll 1d20**: Roll 1  dice and read the results.
3. **Calculate Result**: Add the total from the dice roll to the character’s Aspects and any other invoked aspect.
4. **Compare to Difficulty**: Compare the final result to the difficulty level (Target Success Number) set by the GM.

![[Pasted image 20240703181757.png]]

### Interpreting Results

- **Success**: If the final result meets or exceeds the difficulty level, the character succeeds in the task.
    
- **Failure**: If the final result is less than the difficulty level, the character fails.
    
- **Degrees of Success or Failure**: The difference between the final result and the difficulty level can be used to determine the degree of success or failure. For example, a result that exceeds the difficulty by a large margin indicates a particularly successful outcome, while a result far below the difficulty indicates a significant failure.
       
- **Success with Boon**: when players exceed the success margin by 8 they may introduce a narrative aspect to the scene or the target of their action for free with a rating of 1.


### Player Success Difficulty VS Target Success Number

The GM will either tell the players the Target Success Number or the Player Success Difficulty they must hit to accomplish tasks following the table below. These values can be adjusted depending on scenarios; the GM is free to adjust these values accordingly.

|TSN|PSQ|
|---|---|
|35|Legendary|
|30|Very Difficult|
|25|Difficult|
|20|Very Hard|
|15|Hard|
|10|Average|
|5|Easy|

### Difficulty Tables

Below are tables containing the success rate of rolls when against certain difficulties and with modifiers from 0 to 9. GMs can use these tables to quickly glance at the chances of certain rolls to succeed under several conditions and quickly map the likelihood of success they want to set for a roll under those circumstances. Let's say Players are averaging +5 modifiers on their current state, GMs can use difficulty 10 for relatively easy tasks, 15 for tasks with approximately 50% success rate, and 20 for challenging yet doable tasks. Use these tables to keep the rolls engaging while players progress and upgrade their characters, by making them feasible but challenging.

Notice that difficulty changes in degrees of 5, so adding 1 or removing 1 from the difficulty will change the likelihood or a roll to succeed by 5%.
To get the roof of a success change of a roll you can add 1 to the modifier, every difficulty bellow that number will be an automatic success. If you add 11 to a modifier you can find the 50% chance difficulty.
The ceiling of difficulties above 30 can simply be calculated by adding the modifier to 20, for instance a player rolling on a +15 modifier will have 5 percent chance to succeed a 35 difficulty roll.

### Combat and Opposed Actions

- **Turn Order:** In structured encounters like combat, players must determine the order of action. They do so by rolling a d20 and adding their highest Character Aspect. For instance, a character with a "Wise librarian" aspect might not be faster than a character with an "Agile monk" aspect, but the first one might be more aware a combat situation might arise. Players and NPCs then determine the slots of action based on these rolls. These slots of action are either given to Players or NPCs based on the results and until the first turn remain empty. When the round reaches a turn set as a Player's turn, the Players then decide who will take a turn in that slot of action; the same goes for an NPC slot with the GM. This order established in the first round is then used until the end of the encounter.
    
- **Combat Turn:** On their turns, players can take an action and perform one maneuver in whichever order they desire. Actions are any effort that might require a roll. If an effort can be achieved without a roll, it is considered a maneuver. When performing an action against a target, if the target is a character, be it a player or NPC, the players perform an opposed action; otherwise, the roll is done normally with the GM setting a difficulty.
    
- **Opposed Action:** When performing an opposed action, all parts involved will perform opposing rolls. First, the active player or GM will roll for the action they want to perform using the applicable aspects they can invoke. Then, the opposing player or GM will roll for a reaction using a single Character aspect to denote an instinctive response. _When an aspect is used in a reaction roll, that aspect is exhausted until the end of the opposing player's next turn, not being usable until then.
- ***Rejoinder*:** The active player can, after all rolls have resolved, invoke 1 additional Character aspect by exhausting it until the end of the of their next turn to add its value to the calculation given the aspect has narrative relevance.

- **Cooperative Action:** Players can join together in cooperative actions, adding aspects from all players involved in the action. The maximum limit of aspects added will be the highest maximum limit of all participating characters. Aspects pooled this way are not exhausted and can be used later on as normal, but in structured encounters, players can only act in a cooperative action on the turn of the latest participating player in turn order.
    

### Damage, Health, and Conditions

 Each wound received by players is marked on a division of the threshold box, when all divisions are marked the player moves to the next box. Each threshold has a negative modifier to all rolls that character makes.

| _Scracthed_ | _ _ _  Hurt _ _ _ | _Very Hurt_ | _Incapacitated_ | _Near Death_ | _Dead_ |
| :---------: | :---------------: | :---------: | :-------------: | :----------: | :----: |
|             |                   |             |                 |              |        |
|     (0)     |       (-1)        |    (-2)     |      (-3)       |     (-5)     |   X    |
Players divide these spaces into the number of divisions marked bellow by default.

| Threshold     | Divisions |
| ------------- | --------- |
| Scracthed     | 3         |
| Hurt          | 3         |
| Very Hurt     | 2         |
| Incapacitated | 2         |
| Near Death    | 2         |
| Dead          | 1         |
Special Characteristics can change the number of divisions on each threshold.

When an attack roll succeeds the damage is equal to the difference between the  the active player rolled result and the Target Success Number rolled by the opposition to a maximum of the sum of the modifiers used.

(Active player roll result + modifiers) - (Opposition roll result + modifiers)

### NPCs, Monsters and Encounters

**Minions:** Single aspect defines them, can invoke 1 aspect per roll.

**Rivals:** 2 aspects and up to 1 special characteristics define them, can invoke 2 aspects per roll.

**Nemesis:** 2 Major aspects, up to 3 Extra aspects, up to 2 special characteristic define them, can invoke 3 aspects per roll.

### Variants and optional rules
These are examples of variations that can be either swapped in or added to the base rules, players are free to use them or take them as inspiration to modify the system to their liking.

###### **Static reaction rating**
Instead of rolling a dice when targeted by an action characters have a rating that sets the difficulty of the roll targeting them. Targeted players can still invoke an aspect to boost that rating when applicable and attacking players may exert as usual. The suggested initial rating is 12.

###### **Attributes replace major aspects**
From -1 to +5, can be any skill set, default is strength, agility, intelligence, charisma, wisdom and constitution. Start with 2 (+2) and 2 (+1)

###### **Skills replace minor aspects** 
From 0 to +5 and replace minor aspects, characters start with 1(+2) and 2(+1)

*When using attributes or skills the GM will have a bigger say on which to use so their values are usually set higher.*

*When rolling with skills or attributes first the player decides the action they wanna take, then the GM sets the attributes, skill or both, the the player and GM can invoke relevant aspects. Using skills or attributes count towards the max aspect invocation.*

###### Hidden difficulty

###### **Challenge Pool**
Target number players have to reach with multiple added actions to succeed, instead of a difficulty set, players must roll and add results until they meet the challenge roll. GMs can set a maximum number of actions before the challenge fail. For instance a GM can set a challenge pool of 60 and give players a maximum number of rolls of 5. Players can use a challenge pool card and dice to track the amount added and total actions taken

###### **Currency** 
Can be an Aspect that ranks up indicating wealth or can be a set value.

###### **No wounds or stress** 
For a simpler game play loop players can decided to not use wounds or stress in their games, this option can work for shorter games that have a set resolution.

###### **Mutual Goal**
An inline graded goal tracker from 0 to X, all actions players succeed in move the goal tracker, all actions failed or successful actions by opposing actors move the tracker back 1 point. The GM can set a point when the goal bar is checked to see if the players succeed and by how much. To keep the pace engaging GMs can set a point of no return or milestones in the goal tracker, when players get past that point by a margin of 5 they cannot let the tracker fall back below it.

**Doom Goal tracker:** the GM can have a visible or hidden opposing goal tracker, this can be an active opposing force or the failure possibility growing with time. In this case failed player rolls add to the Doom Goal tracker as well as opposing rolls successes.

###### **More rerolls** 
When players exhaust their dices for rerolls they exhaust it only until the end of their next roll.

### Special characteristics (Classes, races, types, progression, etc…)
These optional special characteristics can be used to mechanically and thematically customized each character. Their goal is to diversify characters and give players specialization paths. These special characteristics can be used to create classes, races, archetypes and leveling paths by the GM.
